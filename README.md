# Dealer Rewards Platform (Be-United)

This project is a comprehensive platform that connects clients (dealers) and a company, enabling clients to order products directly from the company and earn points in return. These points can be redeemed for a wide range of gifts, including everyday items such as phones, headphones, speakers, makeup kits, and more.

## Features

The platform has two distinct sides:

### Admin Side 🛠️

Admins have the ability to:

- ➕ Create new gifts
- ✔️ Confirm gifts redeemed by the user (dealer)
- 🤝 Add new clients and peers to the platform
- 📅 Offer discounts on orders based on dates

### Client Side 🛒

Clients have the ability to:
- 🛍️ Place orders
- 🌟 Earn points
- 🎁 Redeem points for a variety of gifts
- 📊 View a dashboard that displays important data such as points, sales of the month, and more

The platform also provides multiple payment options for a seamless user experience.

## Goal 🚀

Our project aims to provide a user-friendly and efficient platform that enhances the overall experience of both clients and admins.
